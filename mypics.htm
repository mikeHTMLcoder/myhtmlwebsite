<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="comic sans ms">	This is my planted 10 gallon aquarium. That I created out of some free glass that I got off chragslist and spare parts. I had a filter lying around and found the glass rims for free on a curb. Why not set up another aquarium? At the time, I was very interested in nano, or small planted aquariums that are made to just show off the beauty of plants. It is set up and running now and I will be purchasing blue shrimp to keep in it as soon as they are shipped into my local aquarium shop. It has 3 mystery snails that live in it that I got from my other frined in Maine. He is also the one who sent me the driftwood in the aquarium that you can see has moss planted on it. So far I have 6 plant species in this aquarium, but hope to increase it to 8 in the near future once I install a Carbon Dioxide sistem.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="comic sans ms"><FONT COLOR="#39FF14">I had a great vacation last summer. This is a picture of when I was visiting my relatives in Maine and my cousin let me use his dirt bike. It goes very fast, almost up to 25 miles per hour and has a very powerfull engine. We took it to an old dirt bike racing place where there were hills of sand and dirt everywhere that you could do stunts on. It was a great, memorabe experience riding around on a fast bike. I am considering purchasing one but certain models are illegal in California because of emissions regulations. Still, owning a dirt bike and riding it is extremely fun!</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></FONT>
