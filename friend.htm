<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello this is my paragraph. To find out the rare story of the tree octopus, keep reading. It is a very long story about nothing, no one, never, and no light. There is nothing nowhere to be seen, heard, smelled or touched. There are no people, living things, or air. Nothing, nowhere, no one. This paragraph is a sample so might as well make an interesting intro instead of the usual "Lorem ipsum dolor" garbage to waste 30 seconds of your life :)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I have many friends. One of my old frineds name is Ethan. He is a good friend, he helps out everyone whenever they need help. He is also generous, trustworthy, and forgiving. Ethan is a great friend to have and I'm glad we have been friends since fifth grade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
