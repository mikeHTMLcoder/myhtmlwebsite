<P>Whats up?
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello this is my paragraph. To find out the rare story of the tree octopus, keep reading. It is a very long story about nothing, no one, never, and no light. There is nothing nowhere to be seen, heard, smelled or touched. There are no people, living things, or air. Nothing, nowhere, no one. This paragraph is a sample so might as well make an interesting intro instead of the usual "Lorem ipsum dolor" garbage to waste 30 seconds of your life :)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<MARQUEE BGCOLOR="red" DIRECTION=RIGHT>Now on to my friends paragraph :)</MARQUEE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have many friends. One of my old frineds name is Stas. He is a great friend, he helps out everyone whenever they need help. He is also generous, trustworthy, and forgiving. Stas is a great friend to have and I'm glad we have been friends for over a year. Stas and I both like to keep fish and aquariums, and he is training to become a pilot in college now. Next time I visit him, he will give me a flight on his propeller plane!</BLOCKQUOTE>
